I like retro-looking stuff and ASCII art, so I try to implement a little of that into the things I make. I'm also very fond of music, psychology, philosophy, poetry, video-games, and so on. So, I might bring these things together in form of code, from time to time, or just be inspired by them when coding.

Languages:
- C
- Shell (Bash, ZSH, Posix)
- Python
- Rust
- Java
- Markdown


I use Void Linux.

I like retro-looking stuff and ASCII art, so I try to implement a little of that into the things I take on. I'm also very fond of music, psychology, philosophy, poetry, videogames, and so on. So, I might bring these things together in form of code, from time to time.

Currently:  

-	Studying CS at UFRJ
-	Trying to maintain a routine
-	Learning French
	-	oui oui hon hon level of proficiency
-	Polishing what I learned of C
	-	While also learning what's left
-	Learning Python
-	Learning Java
-	Learning ZSH and Bash language
-	Still trying to maintain a routine
